abstract = {We report on state-of-the-art AlGaN/GaN heterostructure field-effect transistor (HFET) technology in the scope of millimeter-wave applications. 60-nm-long-gate HFETs having 4- and 6-nm-thick Al0.4Ga0.6N barrier layers and SiN passivation layers formed by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD) were fabricated on 4H-SiC substrates. Both structures had low sheet resistances of 200–220 $\Omega$/sq that were due to not only high mobilities of 1900–2000 cm2/(V{\textperiodcentered}s) but also high electron densities of (1.4-1.7)×1013 cm-2, which were provided by the high-Al-composition barrier layers and the Cat-CVD SiN. The devices with the 4- and 6-nm-thick barriers had maximum drain current densities of 1.4 and 1.6 A/mm and peak extrinsic transconductances of 448 and 424 mS/mm, respectively. Maximum fT and fmax reached 190 and 251 GHz, respectively. {\textcopyright}2008 The Japan Society of Applied Physics},

We employed two novel techniques, which were thin, high-Al-composition AlGaN barrier layers and SiN gate-insulating, passivation layers formed by catalytic chemical vapor deposition, to enhance high-frequency device characteristics by suppressing the short channel effect. The HFETs with L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}G{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}=0.06-0.2 {\&}mu;m had a maximum drain current density of 1.17-1.24 A/mm at a gate bias of +1.0 V and a peak extrinsic transconductance of 305-417 mS/mm. The current-gain cutoff frequency (f{\textless}sub{\textgreater}T{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) was 163 GHz, which is the highest value to have been reported for GaN HFETs. The maximum oscillation frequency (f{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) was also high, and its value derived from the maximum stable gain or unilateral gain was 192 or 163 GHz, respectively.},

The current gain cutoff frequency does not vary significantly for 2.5 {\textless}; VDS {\textless}; 10 V, while fMAX reaches a maximum value of fMAX = 230 GHz at VDS = 6 V. This is the first realization of fully passivated AlInN/GaN HEMTs with fT/fMAX ≥ 205 GHz, a performance enabled by the careful shaping of the gate electrode profile and the use of a thin 60-nm SiN encapsulation film.},

@article{Palacios2006a,
abstract = {GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are the most promising option for power amplification at frequencies above 30 GHz. However, the difficult technology of nitride devices has hindered the aggressive scaling of these transistors needed for high frequency applications. Also, the need of a relatively thick passivation layer to avoid current collapse in these transistors has significantly limited the high frequency performance of the devices. In this paper, we introduces an advanced technology which uses a Ge sacrificial layer to fabricate passivated AlGaN/GaN HEMTs with gate lengths down to 90 nm, while maintaining a high breakdown voltage and minimum parasitic capacitances. Using these devices, we demonstrate record high frequency performance at both small and large signal levels},
