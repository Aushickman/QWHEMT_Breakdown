abstract = {High-performance p-channel transistors are crucial to implementing efficient complementary circuits in wide-bandgap electronics, but progress on such devices has lagged far behind their powerful electron-based counterparts due to the inherent challenges of manipulating holes in wide-gap semiconductors. Building on recent advances in materials growth, this work sets simultaneous records in both on-current (10 mA/mm) and on-off modulation (four orders) for the GaN/AlN wide-bandgap p-FET structure. A compact analytical pFET model is derived, and the results are benchmarked against the various alternatives in the literature, clarifying the heterostructure trade-offs to enable integrated wide-bandgap CMOS for next-generation compact high-power devices.},

abstract = {Double heterostructures of strained GaN quantum wells (QWs) sandwiched between relaxed AlN layers provide a platform to investigate the quantum-confined electronic and optical properties of the wells. The growth of AlN/GaN/AlN heterostructures with varying GaN quantum well thicknesses on AlN by plasma molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is reported. Photoluminescence spectra provide the optical signature of the thin GaN QWs. Reciprocal space mapping in X-ray diffraction shows that a GaN layer as thick as ∼28 nm is compressively strained to the AlN layer underneath. The density of the polarization-induced two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the undoped heterostructures increases with the GaN QW thickness, reaching ∼2.5 × 1013/cm2. This provides a way to tune the 2DEG channel density without changing the thickness of the top barrier layer. Electron mobilities less than ∼400 cm2/Vs are observed, leaving ample room for improvement. Nevertheless, owing to the high 2DEG density, strained GaN QW field-effect transistors with MBE regrown ohmic contacts exhibit an on-current density ∼1.4 A/mm, a transconductance ∼280 mS/mm, and a cut off frequency f T ∼ 104   GHz for a 100-nm-gate-length device. These observations indicate high potential for high-speed radio frequency and high voltage applications that stand to benefit from the extreme-bandgap and high thermal conductivity of AlN.},

Experimental results provide unambiguous proof that a 2D hole gas in GaN grown on AlN does not need acceptor doping, and can be formed entirely by the difference in the internal polarization fields across the semiconductor heterojunction. The measured 2D hole gas densities, about {\$}4 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}, are among the highest among all known semiconductors and remain unchanged down to cryogenic temperatures. Some of the lowest sheet resistances of all wide-bandgap semiconductors are seen.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  {\&}  Co. KGaA, Weinheim. AlN-based HEMTs grown on silicon by ammonia-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (NH 3 -MBE) are demonstrated and studied. As shown by photoluminescence, the very thin GaN channel (35-55nm-thick) is compressively strained on the 250nm-thick relaxed AlN buffer layer grown on silicon substrate. The structure is then completed by an 8nm-thick AlN barrier and 2nm-thick GaN cap. Despite an ultrathin total epilayer (only ≈300nm-thick), a high 2DEG density (≈2.7×10 13 cm -2 ) is measured by Hall effect. Room temperature mobility values, as high as 636cm 2 V -1 s -1 , are measured. They are higher than those reported on similar structures grown on sapphire, SiC and bulk AlN substrates, showing the interest of growing such structures on silicon substrate. Also, low contact resistance values are obtained, as low as 0.18$\Omega$mm, by using a basic fabrication process.},

abstract = {Gallium-nitride (GaN) technology for power conversion is maturing, with a growing need to evaluate the capabilities of GaN devices in high switching frequency and elevated ambient temperature operation. These capabilities may particularly benefit systems constrained by strict EMI standards, due to the possibility of significant size and weight reduction. An inductive load tester circuit has been developed for switching characterization of a GaN transistor (EPC1010) and a paired silicon diode (SBR10U200P5). Maximum measured switching speeds for hard switching turn-on and turn-off transitions were dv/dt(on) = 4 V/ns, di/dt(on) = 4.5 A/ns, and dv/dt(off) = 18 V/ns, di/dt(off) = 5 A/ns respectively. Total measured switching energy loss was Etot = 40 �J under 100 V supply voltage and 15 A load current conditions, with little change with increase of transistor junction temperature from 25 �C to 100 �C. Zero-voltage switching reduced loss to only Etot = 6 �J, thus enabling high switching frequency operation. As the switching pair of a silicon diode and an EPC1010 is not suitable in hard switching mode and high switching frequency operation due to high switching loss of the turn-on process, another tester was built. Here, two EPC1010 devices were used in a phase-leg configuration. The fastest switching speeds were dv/dt(on) = 21 V/ns, di/dt(on) = 9 A/ns, and dv/dt(off) = 20 V/ns, di/dt(off) = 2 A/ns respectively. Total measured switching energy loss was Etot = 11 �J, under 100 V supply voltage and 15 A load current conditions.},

This method is very efficient in finding eigenstates extending over relatively large spatial areas without loss of accuracy. For confirmation of the accuracy of this method, a comparison is made with the exactly calculated eigenstates of GaAs/AlGaAs rectangular wells.

abstract = {— This paper reports on state-of-the-art millimeter-wave power performance of N-polar GaN-based metal–insulator–semiconductor high-electron-mobility transistors at 30 and 94 GHz. The performance is enabled by our N-polar deep recess structure, whereby a GaN cap layer is added in the access regions of the transistor to simultaneously enhance the access region conductivity while mitigating dc-to-RF dispersion. The impact of lateral scaling of the drain access region length is examined using the tradeoff between breakdown voltage and small-signal gain. Load-pull measurements are presented at 94 GHz, corresponding to the target device operating frequency in W-band, where the device demonstrated a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 28.8{\%} at 16 V and record-high maximum output power density of 8 W/mm at 20 V. Additional load-pull measurements at 30 and 10 GHz demonstrate the viability of this device across a wide frequency range where the peak power remained constant at 8 W/mm and with peak PAEs of 56{\%} and 58{\%}, respectively.

abstract = {This paper reports 1.89 S/mm extrinsic transconductance, 4 A/mm drain current density, and 0.23 $\Omega$-mm on-resistance on depletion-mode nitrogen-polar GaN MIS-HEMTs with a 5.4-nm GaN channel and a novel InAlN/AlGaN back barrier grown by MOCVD on a vicinal sapphire substrate. These dc figures of merit are among the best values reported for all GaN HEMTs. Additionally, an fT of 204 GHz using a 70-nm T-gate (14.3 GHz*$\mu$m fT*Lg product) and an fmax of 405 GHz using a 90-nm T-gate were obtained. These frequency figures of merit match the state-of-the-art Ga-polar devices with similar gate lengths. GaN-based HEMTs have demonstrated tremendous performance in high-frequency, high-power applications due to the high electron velocity, sheet charge density, and critical electric field of the III-N material system. The dc and high-frequency performance of N-polar and Ga-polar HEMTs has increased rapidly as the result of highly scaled device dimensions and advanced epitaxial structures [1]-[4].},

abstract = {This paper reports 400-GHz !lII ax using a tall-stem T-gate on an N-polar GaN/InAIN MIS-HEMT grown by MOCVD. This is the highest reported !lII ax value to date for an N-polar GaN HEMT and is among the highest values for all GaN HEMTs. GaN-based HEMTs have tremendous potential for high-frequency operation due to the high electron velocity and high sheet charge density. The high-frequency performance of both N-polar and Ga-polar HEMTs has increased rapidly as the device gate length, source-drain spacing, and gate-channel spacing have decreased [1]-[4]. Nitrogen-polar HEMTs have advantages over Ga-polar HEMTs including a built­ in back barrier for improved electron confinement, extremely low contact resistance [S], and greater flexibility in scaling the gate-channel distance as the 2DEG charge is determined by the back barrier instead of the top barrier. Many high-frequency performance results recently reported in the literature were obtained with extremely small rectangular gates [2]-[4]. These breakthrough fr results have demonstrated that GaN­ based HEMTs are capable of achieving frequency performance beyond what has been theorized. However, due to the high gate resistance of these rectangular-gate devices, the !lII ax performance is nearly an order of magnitUde lower thanfr. A less-resistive and more process-intensive T-gate [1], [6] is required for the high !lII ax that is essential for many applications. A properly designed T-gate minimizes gate resistance (Rg) and parasitic gate-drain capacitance (Cgd) , both of which would otherwise degrade !lII ax. The devices in this work were fabricated using the tall-stem T-gate process reported in Ref. 6. The epitaxial structure of the devices reported in this work is given in Fig. 1, including a lO-nm GaN channel with an InAIN back barrier and 4.5-nm high-temperature MOCVD SiN gate dielectric. The growth details are similar to those already reported [7]. As InAIN can be grown lattice-matched to GaN, it provides a strain-free barrier layer, and the higher polarization charge of InAIN relative to AIGaN allows higher 2DEG sheet densities. The sheet resistance as measured by TLM structures for the devices in this work is 280 Ohm/sq, which resulted in a device on-resistance (Ron) of 0.29 Ohm-mm for Lg = 100 nm and 175-nm source-drain spacing. This Ron is the lowest reported for a non-self-aligned GaN HEMT and matches the lowest reported Ron for a self-aligned GaN HEMT [1]. The saturated drain current at Vgs = 0 V is 1.9 A/mm as shown in Fig. 2 with excellent saturation and pinch-off characteristics. The transfer curves show an extrinsic dc transconductance of 323 mS/mm at Vds = 3 V and extremely low 28.9 m V N drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL)-defined as change in threshold voltage per drain bias. As shown in Fig. 3a, the device with Wg = 2x12.S 11m and Lg = 100 nm obtained a peakfr of 144 GHz at Vds = 8 V and Vgs = -4.5 V, and the dc and RF gill for this bias was 480 and 600 mS/mm, respectively. The small-signal S-parameters of this device were measured at biases up to Vds = 8 V and Vgs = -4.S V without breaking down. Thus, the gate-drain distance of -so nm supported a voltage of -12.S V.

Thanks to the combination of high electron mobility, regrown n+ InGaN/GaN ohmic contacts and scaled source-to-drain distance, the devices have an very low on-resistance of 0.4 $\Omega${\textperiodcentered}mm. This very low resistance enables a significant reduction of the transistor parasitic delay and devices with a peak fT of 317 GHz have been demonstrated for a 26 nm gate length. The device performance is limited by a relatively thick top barrier which causes serious short-channel effects (SCEs) in the devices with gate length below 50 nm.
