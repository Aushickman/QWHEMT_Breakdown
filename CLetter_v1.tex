Dear Editor,

\bigskip
Please find the enclosed manuscript entitled \textit{``High Breakdown Voltage in Strained AlN/GaN/AlN Quantum Well HEMTs"}, by Austin Hickman, Reet Chaudhuri, Samuel James Bader, Kazuki Nomoto, Kevin Lee, Huili Grace Xing, and Debdeep Jena which is being submitted for publication in Electron Device Letters.

The high-power performance of GaN HEMTs is in large part defined by the breakdown voltage of the devices. In recent publications, our group introduced the AlN/GaN/AlN HEMT, which takes advantage of AlN's superior bandgap and thermal conductivity to improve high voltage performance. With great excitement, we share with the community the first study of the breakdown characteristics of strained AlN/GaN/AlN quantum well HEMTs, and benchmark results against state-of-the-art GaN HEMTs. The resulting breakdown voltages are among the highest reported for any submicron-channel nitride HEMT. Combine with carrier confinement provided by the AlN, these devices are an exciting candidate for the future of high-power, high-frequency RF electronics.

Sincerely yours,
